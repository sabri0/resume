deploy the site in the public cloud
Running a basic Apache web server
A virtual machine instance on Compute Engine can be controlled like any standard Linux server. 
Deploy a simple Apache web server in a virtual machine instance by typing


sudo apt update


sudo apt install apache2


By default, Apache comes with a basic site (the one that we saw in the previous step) enabled. We can modify its content in /var/www/html 
copy the content of this repository in the html folder and access you IP address or the domaine
